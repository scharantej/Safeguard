 ## **Python Flask Expert Assistant**

### **Problem Analysis**
The problem at hand is to create a content moderation classifier for Google safety policies using Python Flask. This classifier will analyze user-generated content and determine whether it violates any of Google's safety policies.

### **Flask Application Design**
To solve this problem, we will design a Flask application with the following structure:

#### **HTML Files**
- **index.html**: This will be the main page of our application. It will contain a form for users to submit content for moderation.
- **results.html**: This page will display the results of the moderation process. It will show whether the submitted content is safe or violates any of Google's safety policies.

#### **Routes**
- **index**: This route will render the index.html page.
- **moderate**: This route will handle the moderation process. It will receive the user-submitted content, analyze it, and determine whether it violates any of Google's safety policies. The results of the moderation process will be displayed on the results.html page.

### **Explanation**
The index.html page will contain a simple form with a text area for users to enter their content. The form will submit the content to the moderate route.

The moderate route will receive the user-submitted content and analyze it using a content moderation library. This library will check the content against Google's safety policies and determine whether it violates any of them.

If the content is safe, the moderate route will redirect the user to the results.html page and display a message indicating that the content is safe.

If the content violates any of Google's safety policies, the moderate route will redirect the user to the results.html page and display a message indicating the specific policy that was violated.

### **Conclusion**
This Flask application design provides a simple and effective way to moderate user-generated content and ensure that it complies with Google's safety policies.
